                        In its short history, the Internet has had a revolutionizing effect, not only on communications and computing, 
                        but also on broader areas of life such as economics, culture, language, and social relations. In that same time, 
                        however, the Internet and, subsequently, the World Wide Web have undergone a number of permutations, and the 
                        intentions of its developers have not always coincided with the ways in which the technology has been realized. 
                        As the technology and its influence spread, of course, the designs of the original planners were diluted. From 
                        its origins as a military-based, Pentagon-funded networking architecture for experimental communications, the 
                        Internet flowered into perhaps the most sweeping revolution in the history of communications technology. The 
                        World Wide Web, meanwhile, grew from a vehicle designed to universalize the Internet and democratize electronically 
                        based information to a commercial juggernaut that transformed the way business is conducted.

                        Although in the popular imagination the Internet is a feature of the 1990s, the earliest inklings of the possibilities 
                        of networked computers can be traced to the early 1960s. In 1962, J.C.R. Licklider at the Massachusetts Institute of 
                        Technology (MIT) first elucidated his dream of a "Galactic Network" connecting computers across the globe for the distribution 
                        and access of data and programs. Licklider went on to become the first director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
                        (DARPA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense and the body that funded and coordinated the original research into what 
                        became the Internet.

                    <p>
                        Licklider's MIT colleagues Leonard Kleinrock and Lawrence G. Roberts performed the ground-breaking work toward the 
                        development of the Inter-net's architecture. First, Kleinrock published a revolutionary paper touting the plausibility 
                        of using packet switching rather than circuits for communications, thereby paving the way for the necessary computer 
                        networking. Roberts built on Kleinrock's theories to devise the first wide-area computing network, using a regular, 
                        circuit-based telephone line to allow computers in Massachusetts and California to communicate directly. While the 
                        computers were indeed able to run programs and exchange data, Roberts was convinced that Roberts's insistence on the 
                        superiority of packet switching was correct.

                        Having joined DARPA, Roberts in 1967 presented a paper outlining his vision for the original version of the Internet, 
                        known as ARPANET, the specifications of which were set by the following fall. Roberts's main position was that the network 
                        DARPA was building could be expanded and put to greater use once it was completed. Kleinrock relocated to UCLA just in time 
                        for DARPA to send a proposal for the further development of his packet switching ideas for the network DARPA was constructing. 
                        Keleinrock and a handful of other interested scholars at UCLA established the Network Measurement Center for the ARPANET project.

                    <p>
                        ARPANET's first host computer was set up at Kleinrock's Network Measurement Center at the University of California-Los Angeles 
                        (UCLA) in 1969, and other nodes, at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah in 
                        Salt Lake City, were connected shortly afterward. As computers were added to ARPENET, the Network Working Group worked to devise 
                        a communication protocol that would enable different networks to talk to each other, resulting in the host-to-host Network 
                        Control Protocol (NCP), which was rolled out in 1970. Thus the Internet as we know it today began to bloom.

                        Still, for the first few years of its existence, ARPANET was largely unknown outside of the relatively esoteric group of 
                        technologists that was developing it. That changed in 1972, Robert Kahn of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), one of the chief 
                        figures in the development of the ARPANET architecture, organized a conference at the International Computer Communication 
                        Conference (ICCC) where ARPANET was first demonstrated publicly. That same year, the first major Internet application, 
                        called electronic mail, or e-mail, was introduced. Over the next decade, e-mail was the most widely used network application 
                        in existence.

                    <p>
                        The early years of ARPANET saw the network grow slowly, as nodes were gradually added and the vast array of computers plugged 
                        into it demanded software and interface hardware so as to adequately interact with ARPANET. As ARPANET expanded into what is 
                        now referred to as the Internet, it was grounded on what is known as an open architecture network. In such an environment, 
                        other networks could connect to and interact with the Internet and all other networks to which it is connected, but the 
                        technology used to build each network could be decided by that network's provider and needn't be dictated by any particular 
                        architecture. Packet switching, pioneered by Kleinrock, allowed for such architectural freedom to connect networks on a peer, 
                        rather than hierarchical, basis. In fact, open-architecture networking was originally referred to as "Internetting" when it was 
                        introduced to DARPA in 1972.

                        While this greatly expanded the uses of the Internet in its limited environment of the day, enabling network designers to tailor 
                        their architectures to the specific needs of their users while still linking it to the overall Internet, it resulted in the lack 
                        of a common user interface on the Internet. In fact, most of the early networks connected to the Internet were designed for a closed 
                        community of researchers and scholars, so the issue of cross-network capacity was a very low priority. For academics, military officials, 
                        and scientists, this was satisfactory on the whole as the Internet was geared toward very specialized users. It limited the overall 
                        availability of the Internet, however, in a manner that wouldn't be remedied until the 1990s and the introduction of the World Wide Web.

                        For several years, the bulk of the research involving Internet communications, including work on the various networking and transmission 
                        logistical concerns, was funded primarily by the United States Department of Defense, and thus was primarily designed around and translated 
                        into military concerns. For instance, the first demonstration of an Internet transmission linking three different kinds of gateways, including 
                        a mobile packet radio in California, the Atlantic Packet Satellite Network (SATNET), and several ground-level ARPANET systems through the 
                        eastern United States and Europe, were designed to mimic military scenarios the depended on linking mobile units to central command stations 
                        across an intercontinental network.

                    <p>
                        Network Control Protocol, however, proved limited in an open-architecture environment since it was dependent on the ARPANET network design for 
                        endto-end reliability, and any transmission packets that were compromised could bring the protocol to an abrupt stop. To get multiple packet 
                        networks to communicate with each other regardless of the underlying networking technology, a common communication protocol was needed. The 
                        first efforts toward this end were the work on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) by Vinton Cerf at the Stanford Research Institute 
                        and Robert Kahn at BBN. TCP was designed specifically to sidestep any centralized global control at the level of internetworking operations 
                        using the communications protocol. The design called for gateways, or routers, to connect networks to the Internet without calling for any 
                        network reconfiguration. After several years of research and design, the first TCP specification was published in December 1974. Just a few 
                        months later, DARPA transferred ARPANET as a fully operational Internet to the Defense Communications Agency (later renamed the Defense 
                        Information Systems Agency).

                        By the late 1970s, the U.S. military became interested in Internet technology not just as an experimental and theoretical tool, but as an 
                        actually existing military communications system. As a result, the military began to use Internet communications protocols in packet radio 
                        systems and various ground-satellite stations in Europe. The transfer of voice messages highlighted complications in these radio-based networks 
                        and led to the development of a complementary Internet Protocol (IP), which was combined with TCP to produce the TCP/IP protocol suite. 
                        TCP/IP quickly emerged as the standard for all military Internet systems, and, by extension, the Internet itself.

                    <p>
                        Through the early 1980s, Internet products consolidated into the TCP/IP protocol, setting the stage for the opening of commercial applications. 
                        Sure enough, according to Vinton Cerf, in the mid-1980s a substantial market for Internet-based products began to flower. In large part this was 
                        due to the NSFNet initiative. This program, which was born of a network designed to link supercomputers together based on software designed by 
                        David Mills of the University of Delaware, and which was led by Dennis Jennings at the National Science Foundation (NSF), quickly generated 
                        supporting software and systems by IBM, MCI, and Merit to accommodate the quickly escalating networking demand. Thanks to the outgrowth of 
                        technologies stemming from NSFNet, the number of computers connected to the Internet jumped from only several hundred in 1983 to over 1.3 million 
                        in 1993, while the number of networks leapt from a tiny handful to over 10,000. By 1990, the NSFNet, in fact, had generated such a profound 
                        transformation in the Internet's backbone and reach that ARPANET itself was decommissioned. Soon commercial e-mail carriers, already devising 
                        systems and software for use in intranets, began exploiting the possibilities of Internet-based e-mail; commercial Internet service providers 
                        came along in their wake, sprouting up from the original handful of networks brought to life under NSFNet. For several years, however, these 
                        services were still primarily geared toward researchers and businesses-those few groups that already had a need for and access to the Internet. 
                        The Internet as a household resource was still largely unheard of.

                        The rapid expansion of the Internet in the 1980s necessitated new methods of management such as the Domain Name System (DNS). In its earliest 
                        incarnations, users had to memorize numerical addresses to access the fairly limited number of host networks, but that became unfeasible as the 
                        number of connected networks took off. With the proliferation of local area networks (LANs), Internet managers designed the DNS to create easily 
                        identifiable hierarchies of hosts to facilitate easy Internet navigation.

                        In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of policy initiatives, including a forum at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government on "The Commercialization 
                        and Privatization of the Internet" and a National Research Council committee report titled "Towards a National Research Network," paved the way for the next 
                        steps of Internet evolution, including the sponsorship by the U.S. government of high-speed computer networks that would serve as the backbone for the 
                        explosion of the information super-highway and e-commerce in the 1990s.

                        Perhaps the invention that most facilitated the growth of the Internet as a global information-sharing system is the World Wide Web. Unlike the Internet, 
                        however, the early design and development of the World Wide Web was primarily the doing of just one person: Tim Berners-Lee. Working as a contract 
                        programmer at the Geneva, Switzerland-based Centre Europen de Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory for Particle Physics, or CERN), Berners-Lee 
                        repeatedly proposed to develop a global interactive interface for use on the Internet so as to turn the fragmented and relatively exclusive Internet 
                        into a popular and seamless whole. After several rejections, Berners-Lee simply developed a prototype using the laboratory's phone-book entries in 
                        1989. Called Enquire Within Upon Everything, the prototype was designed to link and connect elements much in the way that the brain makes random 
                        connections and associations. Unlike the average database system, according to Berners-Lee, the Web was to be designed to make random associations 
                        between arbitrary objects in the files.

                    <p>
                        Just as the Internet evolved to ensure the greatest possible flexibility and interoperability, so the Web's original architectural design specifically 
                        minimized the degree of specification so as to minimize constraints on the user. In this way, the design could be modified and updated while leaving 
                        the basic architecture undisturbed. Thus, for instance, users could enter the existing File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in the address space and it would 
                        be as workable as the new Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP was the communications protocol that allowed the Web to transfer data to and from 
                        any computer connected to the Internet, and was designed as an improvement on the FTP standard in that it took advantage of the Web's capacity to read 
                        and translate intricate features. The intermixing of these protocols and file formats was the key, for Berners-Lee, to ensuring not only the widest 
                        proliferation but also the greatest durability of his creation. Not only would the Web in this way be able to evolve with changing systems and protocols, 
                        but the early adoption would be made smoother in that users could adopt the Web from whatever systems they were currently using as a parallel or 
                        supplementary system. Shortly after the successful demonstration of the phonebook prototype, the Internet community, still relatively esoteric, began 
                        experimenting with browser platforms for viewing the Web. One of the early successes was the Mosaic program written by Marc Andreessen, later the 
                        founder of Netscape.

                    <p>
                        Taking advantage of the Internet's gateways and bypassing centralized registries, Berners-Lee devised the universal resource locators (URLs) that are 
                        the basis for Web addresses under the DNS. URLs were built to highlight the central power of the Web: that any link can connect to any other document 
                        or resource anywhere on the Internet, or in the "universe of information," as Berners-Lee puts it. URLs are structured to identify the kind of space 
                        that is being accessed (for instance, by the prefixes "http:" or "ftp:") followed by the specific address within that information space.

                        he last piece of the WWW puzzle was the medium's lingua franca: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a language of codes, built on hypermedia principles 
                        dating back to the 1940s, that informs the browser how to interpret the files for the Web. By 1991, all the elements were in place, and the World Wide 
                        Web was released from Berners-Lee's laboratory to the public free of any charge.

                        Perhaps the biggest story in the development of the Web through the early and mid-1990s was the fight to stave off the fragmentation of Web standards 
                        that could potentially undermine the ability of the Web to fulfill its original function-namely, to create a seamless universe of information. The World 
                        Wide Web Consortium (W3C), of which Berners-Lee was the founder, was born in 1994 just as the Web was beginning to hit critical mass. The organization, 
                        though not a governing body, was founded to guide and oversee the Web's development and minimize proprietary battles over standards and protocols in an 
                        effort to keep the Web nonproprietary and freely accessible. Based at MIT, the W3C is a neutral organization that brings together technicians, researchers, 
                        policy advocates, software vendors, and business interests to compromise on technical standards and specifications to ensure that the Web remains undivided.

                        Beginning in the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web helped propel the Internet to a new stage of mass consumption, and in the process both were 
                        radically transformed, as was the society that used them. The Internet and World Wide Web opened new fields of debate over social and cultural 
                        concerns, including the right to privacy, the protection of children from harmful or inappropriate materials, freedom of speech as it pertains 
                        to electronic networks, intellectual property, issues of social equality, the security of financial and personal data online, and a host of other 
                        issues.

                        As businesses grew increasingly interested in the Internet and the Web for their own strategies, the race to take advantage of the emerging 
                        e-commerce markets highlighted the needs of commercial interests in the Internet architecture, in Web-and e-mail-based security measures, 
                        and in business models structured on Internet communications and technology. In turn, businesses used these technologies as tools to enter 
                        and take advantage of new markets throughout the world, in the process furthering the proliferation of the Internet and the globalization 
                        of the world's economies. In the process, the range of social and cultural concerns connected to the Web and the Internet were intensified.

                        It is clear that, far from the special provenance of technicians, computer scientists, and scholarly researchers, the Internet and the World 
                        Wide Web by the mid-1990s had evolved into critical components of the national—and increasingly the international—infrastructure, components 
                        with which the rest of economic and social life were increasingly intertwined. As a result, the spate of questions, concerns, cautions, and 
                        enthusiasm about these technologies required careful negotiation to ensure that these forces served the good of everyone they affected. Several 
                        organizations sprouted up for just that purpose, including the W3C and the Internet Society, which brought together diverse interests to 
                        attempt to oversee the development of these technologies within the context of the overall common good. While these debates remained contentious 
                        as competing groups wrangled to assert their positions, and consensus over the future direction of these technologies was far from realization, 
                        there was little doubt that the Internet and the World Wide Web were thoroughly enough integrated into the fabric of society that they would 
                        both affect and be affected by the social forces that attempt to guide them.
